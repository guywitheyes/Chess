# Chess
A chess game that I planned to create using PyGame, but I lost interest in it after a couple weeks. So, I stopped developing it. The only things it can do is selecting and moving pieces. The interface is all ready and all that's left is to implement the actual logic of the game. If someone wants to take over, feel free to download this project code and develop it for yourself. I won't be working on this project any longer.

## Game Interface
This is what the game looks like:

You can select and move pieces:

And that's about all you can do so far. As I said, I'm not interested in this project any longer and won't be developing it further.

## Contributing
If you want to develop this game, feel free to download the project code and work on it. Some pointers if you do:
* The "assets" folder has all the icons, the images, etc.
* The "config" folder contains configuration such as keeping records of all possible moves, loading the icons, images and other assets, and more.
* The "game.py" file creates the Chessboard and creates the Chess Pieces.
* The game loop is in the "app.py" file. This file also handles the logic of selecting and moving pieces.

This should help you get started.
