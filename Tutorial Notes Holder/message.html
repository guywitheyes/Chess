    <h1>Hello there!</h1>

        <p>My name is Hassan, and I am a professional web developer. I've noticed that you don't have a 
        personal website. In this day and age, I think a lot of people would benefit from having a 
        dedicated presence on the web.</p>

        <p>I have extensive experience with technologies such as HTML/CSS/JS and also with back-end 
        frameworks such as Django and Flask. Whether you want a simple functioning website or want a 
        more larger one, I can make the perfect one for you.</p>

        <p>If you think this is something you want to do, please send me a reply explaining what kind of a 
        website you want. I can create you a great website and handle all of the coding and geeky stuff
        so you can do what you do best. I won't charge much either. My primary focus is to build trust and credibility and to provide
        as much value as I can to you, the client.</p>

        <p>Send me a reply and we can get to work! I'm really looking forward to hearing from you! :)</p>
